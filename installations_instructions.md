Preparing yourself and your laptop for package development
===========================================================

To get the best out of the workshop and your ticket $ it'll be optimal for you to have

* a basic familiarity with writing functions in R. You can for instance read [that section from the R4DS book](http://r4ds.had.co.nz/functions.html#functions).

* [The latest versions of R and RStudio](http://stat545.com/block000_r-rstudio-install.html)

* [prepared your system for package development](http://stat545.com/packages01_system-prep.html)

* also installed [usethis](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/usethis/index.html)

* [installed git](http://happygitwithr.com/install-git.html) 

* [created a GitHub account](http://happygitwithr.com/github-acct.html)

At the beginning of this workshop, we expect you to have tried to install everything using the links provided above. 

If you have problems, email MaÃ«lle before the workshop and she'll give you tips or dispatch your question to an helper. On the day of the workshop, helpers can help you finish setting up your laptop. Please come at XXXam.

We'll do everything we can to ensure you enjoy, and leave the workshop with a development environment installed so that you can keep working on the fun stuff once you go home.

Also keep in mind that developping a package will be immensely more fun than installing the development enviromnent but you need to go through that pain to get there. You might also experience no pain and have an easy time installing everything!

Pro tip: keep track of the installations steps you had to tweaked from the guidelines, if any, so as to help future you/other people, and so as to help helpers help you if you got issues.
